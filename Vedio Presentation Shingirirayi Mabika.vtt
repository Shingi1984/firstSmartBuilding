00:00:03.607 --> 00:00:07.907
Today my name is Shingi and I'm
presenting my.

0333d8b7-ddff-4fea-b8d9-c56987a2fa6b/36-0
00:00:08.567 --> 00:00:12.747
Project my assignment. I'm doing
the smart building and I'm going

0333d8b7-ddff-4fea-b8d9-c56987a2fa6b/36-1
00:00:12.747 --> 00:00:16.167
to share my screen to show the
work that I have done.

0333d8b7-ddff-4fea-b8d9-c56987a2fa6b/40-0
00:00:35.117 --> 00:00:35.847
OK.

0333d8b7-ddff-4fea-b8d9-c56987a2fa6b/42-0
00:00:36.987 --> 00:00:37.927
So.

0333d8b7-ddff-4fea-b8d9-c56987a2fa6b/45-0
00:00:38.647 --> 00:00:39.107
Here.

0333d8b7-ddff-4fea-b8d9-c56987a2fa6b/67-0
00:00:39.977 --> 00:00:45.887
You can see that I've got my
application that I've got here.

0333d8b7-ddff-4fea-b8d9-c56987a2fa6b/67-1
00:00:45.887 --> 00:00:48.987
I'm going to open it and run it.

0333d8b7-ddff-4fea-b8d9-c56987a2fa6b/75-0
00:00:50.377 --> 00:00:53.557
SP assignment we had coded.

0333d8b7-ddff-4fea-b8d9-c56987a2fa6b/97-0
00:00:54.237 --> 00:00:59.763
The username and the password.
So welcome to the Smart building

0333d8b7-ddff-4fea-b8d9-c56987a2fa6b/97-1
00:00:59.763 --> 00:01:04.167
application. You press OK you
put in the username.

0333d8b7-ddff-4fea-b8d9-c56987a2fa6b/172-0
00:01:05.307 --> 00:01:10.414
Which is user and persuade 1234.
OK, log in is successful once

0333d8b7-ddff-4fea-b8d9-c56987a2fa6b/172-1
00:01:10.414 --> 00:01:15.684
the login is successful you can
go on to 10 online 8:10 alarm on

0333d8b7-ddff-4fea-b8d9-c56987a2fa6b/172-2
00:01:15.684 --> 00:01:20.548
Enable security, play music or
whatever you want. So if you

0333d8b7-ddff-4fea-b8d9-c56987a2fa6b/172-3
00:01:20.548 --> 00:01:25.656
choose to turn on lights then
the lights will be turned on. If

0333d8b7-ddff-4fea-b8d9-c56987a2fa6b/172-4
00:01:25.656 --> 00:01:30.764
you choose to turn on alarm it
will be turned on. If you in in

0333d8b7-ddff-4fea-b8d9-c56987a2fa6b/172-5
00:01:30.764 --> 00:01:35.547
Enable security it will. If you
play music it plays music.

0333d8b7-ddff-4fea-b8d9-c56987a2fa6b/246-0
00:01:35.717 --> 00:01:40.175
And if you press the exit
buttons, it exits and the same

0333d8b7-ddff-4fea-b8d9-c56987a2fa6b/246-1
00:01:40.175 --> 00:01:45.025
thing happens if you put in a
wrong card, you cannot proceed.

0333d8b7-ddff-4fea-b8d9-c56987a2fa6b/246-2
00:01:45.025 --> 00:01:49.014
Or if you put in a wrong
username or a young wrong

0333d8b7-ddff-4fea-b8d9-c56987a2fa6b/246-3
00:01:49.014 --> 00:01:54.021
password. So for instance if you
put in a wrong password or the

0333d8b7-ddff-4fea-b8d9-c56987a2fa6b/246-4
00:01:54.021 --> 00:01:58.949
wrong username, it will not go
through, then it will fail that

0333d8b7-ddff-4fea-b8d9-c56987a2fa6b/246-5
00:01:58.949 --> 00:02:03.329
specifically the application for
the smart building the

0333d8b7-ddff-4fea-b8d9-c56987a2fa6b/246-6
00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.067
assignment wanted us to
implement.

0333d8b7-ddff-4fea-b8d9-c56987a2fa6b/248-0
00:02:06.177 --> 00:02:06.917
The G.

0333d8b7-ddff-4fea-b8d9-c56987a2fa6b/254-0
00:02:08.587 --> 00:02:10.317
The GRPC.

0333d8b7-ddff-4fea-b8d9-c56987a2fa6b/277-0
00:02:11.407 --> 00:02:17.312
Yes, here is the GRPC and all
these dependencies have been

0333d8b7-ddff-4fea-b8d9-c56987a2fa6b/277-1
00:02:17.312 --> 00:02:22.117
copied as indicated and they can
be shown here.

0333d8b7-ddff-4fea-b8d9-c56987a2fa6b/294-0
00:02:22.987 --> 00:02:28.469
If you Scroll down then you see
all the dependencies that we

0333d8b7-ddff-4fea-b8d9-c56987a2fa6b/294-1
00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:29.997
done and we also.

0333d8b7-ddff-4fea-b8d9-c56987a2fa6b/305-0
00:02:31.907 --> 00:02:36.927
Head to indicate the proto or
the smart building proto.

0333d8b7-ddff-4fea-b8d9-c56987a2fa6b/311-0
00:02:37.697 --> 00:02:39.737
They it is and.

0333d8b7-ddff-4fea-b8d9-c56987a2fa6b/357-0
00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:47.440
These are our protocols where we
have the log in, log out the

0333d8b7-ddff-4fea-b8d9-c56987a2fa6b/357-1
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.871
turn on lights, alarm on in
Nepal security and the play

0333d8b7-ddff-4fea-b8d9-c56987a2fa6b/357-2
00:02:52.871 --> 00:02:58.981
music. That's the Internet. Then
the last one is the saver. So

0333d8b7-ddff-4fea-b8d9-c56987a2fa6b/357-3
00:02:58.981 --> 00:03:00.727
the saver is here.

0333d8b7-ddff-4fea-b8d9-c56987a2fa6b/365-0
00:03:01.997 --> 00:03:04.537
Is indicated we have imported.

0333d8b7-ddff-4fea-b8d9-c56987a2fa6b/441-0
00:03:05.437 --> 00:03:10.421
They Jupiter GRPC server, the
server builder and the stub.

0333d8b7-ddff-4fea-b8d9-c56987a2fa6b/441-1
00:03:10.421 --> 00:03:15.406
This is what we needed the
assignment further or needed us

0333d8b7-ddff-4fea-b8d9-c56987a2fa6b/441-2
00:03:15.406 --> 00:03:20.391
to do the process which are
indicated here we imported the

0333d8b7-ddff-4fea-b8d9-c56987a2fa6b/441-3
00:03:20.391 --> 00:03:25.037
protos and we have logged in in
and here they are. But

0333d8b7-ddff-4fea-b8d9-c56987a2fa6b/441-4
00:03:25.037 --> 00:03:30.360
unfortunately mine is putting up
an error. I could not proceed

0333d8b7-ddff-4fea-b8d9-c56987a2fa6b/441-5
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.007
through but this is what was
needed by the assignment.

0333d8b7-ddff-4fea-b8d9-c56987a2fa6b/444-0
00:03:35.407 --> 00:03:36.197
Thank you.
